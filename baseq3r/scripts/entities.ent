 Q3Map2 entities

=============================================================================
-->

<group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0">
-------- KEYS --------
<target key="target" name="Target">the name of the entity targetted at for projection</target>
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.
</group>

<point name="_skybox" color="0.77 0.88 1.0" box="-4 -4 -4 4 4 4">
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">rotation angle of the sky surfaces.</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).</angles>
<real key="_scale" name="Scale">scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.</real>
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, seperate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

<point name="ammo_bfg" color=".3 .3 1" box="-16 -16 -16 16 16 16" model="models/powerups/ammo/bfgam.md3">
BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
<real key="wait" name="Respawn Delay">time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).</real>
<real key="random" name="Respawn Delay Variance">random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).</real>
<integer key="count" name="Ammo Given">sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).</integer>
<string key="team" name="Team Name">set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).</string>
<target key="target" name="Target">picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.</target>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.</targetname>
<boolean key="notfree" name="Hidden For FFA">when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.</boolean>
<boolean key="notteam" name="Hidden For Teamplay">when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.</boolean>
<boolean key="notsingle" name="Hidden For SP">when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).</boolean>
<boolean key="notbot" name="Invisible To Bots">used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.</boolean> 
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="No Drop To Floor" bit="0">item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

There are 2 ways to use this entity.
a) automatically give items to players when they spawn in the game: make a spawn location entity like info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn points target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player upon respawn.
b) give items to players during the game: make a trigger_multiple target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched.

-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

<real key="_ambient;ambient" name="Ambient Intensity">Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.</real>
<color key="color" name="Ambient Color">RGB value for ambient light color (default is 0 0 0).</color>
<real key="gravity" name="Gravity">gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).</real>
<integer3 key="gridsize" name="Dynamic Light Granularity">granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.</integer3>
<integer key="_blocksize" name="BSP Block Size">q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.</integer>
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
<real key="_minlight" name="Min Lightmap Intensity">Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Does not add unlike ambient.</real>
<real key="_minvertexlight" name="Min Vertex Intensity">Minimum vertex lighting, levelwide.</real>
<real key="_mingridlight" name="Min Dynamic Intensity">Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.</real>
<boolean key="_keeplights" name="Keep Light Entities">Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.</boolean>
<boolean key="_noshadersun" name="Ignore Shader Sun">Ignore q3map_sun/sun directives in sky shaders and ONLY use entity sun lights.</boolean>
<real key="_farplanedist" name="Far Clip Distance">Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.</real>
<texture key="_foghull" name="Fog Hull Shader">Shader to use for "fog hull." Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.</texture>
<real key="_lightmapscale" name="Lightmap Scale">Floating point value scaling the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in the world. Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities) (default 1.0).</real>
<integer key="_castshadows;_cs" name="Shadow Caster Level">Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.</integer>
<integer key="_receiveshadows;_rs" name="Shadow Reciever Level">Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. &lt; 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.</integer>
<texture key="_celshader" name="Cel Shader">Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: omit the "textures/" prefix.</texture> Overridable in entities.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
<texture key="_indexmap;alphamap" name="Terrain Blending Map">Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.</texture>
